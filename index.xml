      <description>Elasticsearch Communicate with Elasticsearch: this is done by issuing HTTP requests against the REST API. Elastic is started by default in port 9200.
Elasticsearch Query DSL The query DSL is a flexible, expressive search language that Elasticsearch uses to expose most of the power of Lucene through a simple JSON interface. It is what you should be using to write your queries in production. It makes your queries more flexible, more precise, easier to read, and easier to debug.</description>

      <description>What is Elastic Stacks The Elastic Stack — formerly known as the ELK Stack — is a collection of open-source software produced by Elastic which allows you to search, analyze, and visualize logs generated from any source in any format, a practice known as centralized logging. Centralized logging can be very useful when attempting to identify problems with your servers or applications, as it allows you to search through all of your logs in a single place.</description>

      <description>Manage the Logstash plugin Logstash has a rich collection of input, filter, codec and output plugins.
Plugins are available as self-contained packages called gems and hosted on RubyGems.org.
The plugin manager accessed via bin/logstash-plugin script is used to manage the lifecycle of plugins in your Logstash deployment. You can install, remove and upgrade plugins using the Command Line Interface (CLI) invocations described below.
# on ubuntu 18.04, you can find the logstash installation in /usr/share/logstash # list all installed plugins bin/logstash-plugin list  Reference Logstash plugin</description>

      <description>What is REST REST, or Representational State Transfer is another way of implementing a Web Service. It is the ideology that everything is a resource. Every resource is identified by a unique uniform resource indicator (URI). An important point to note with REST is that it is stateless. This means that when you access the REST web service to retrieve data, you receive the most current state of the resource (ie.</description>

While this is not the standard shell, it is still available on every Linux system for compatibility with UNIX programs. bash or Bourne Again shell: the standard GNU shell, intuitive and flexible. Probably most advisable for beginning users while being at the same time a powerful tool for the advanced and professional user.</description>

Since I am a user of macOS, a lot of shortcuts and commands are not available on macOS&amp;rsquo;s platform, thus I am going to write my own cheatsheet.
You can also see this one as a best practice of using terminal on macOS.

Bash (/bin/bash) is a popular shell on most if not all Linux systems, and it’s normally the default shell for user accounts.
When creating user accounts with the useradd or adduser utilities, the --shell flag can be used to specify the name of a user’s login shell other than that specified in the respective configuration files.</description>

Terraform is a super useful tool developed by HashiCorp, the main idea of terraform is &amp;ldquo;INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE&amp;rdquo;.
To me, the most attracting feature Cloud Computing is scalability. Infrastructure in Cloud is inifinite. But there are some downsides of traditional cloud library.
For AWS, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried awscli, boto3 and go sdk. For a small test, they are easy to use. But for a big test, there are too many logics and dependencies inside.</description>

      <description>My laptop is running out of storage, since I have a VPS running as VPN server. I found it would be a good practice to setup a MySQL server in remote.
BTW, if you still have AWS free tier, AWS RDS service is super easy and stable.
Install the MySQL server I am not a big fan of ubuntu, on my local, I am using Manjaro. And for remote server, my first choice is always CentOS.</description>

      <description>Normal Numpy Indexing Numpy arrays using:
 simple indices (e.g., arr[0]), slices (e.g., arr[:5]) Boolean masks (e.g., arr[arr &amp;gt; 0])  Numpy Fancy Indexing Fancy indexing is conceptually simple: it means passing an array of indices to access multiple array elements at once.
import numpy as np rand = np.random.RandomState(42) x = rand.randint(100, size=10) print(x) # Output # [51 92 14 71 60 20 82 86 74 74] # Normal indexing [x[3], x[7], x[2]] # [71, 86, 14] # Fancy indexing ind = [3, 7, 4] x[ind] # [71, 86, 14]  When using fancy indexing, the shape of the result reflects the shape of the index arrays rather than the shape of the array being indexed:</description>

      <description>Useful suggestions  The human brain is a complex machine and it&amp;rsquo;s a result of thousands of years of human evolution. Our world has evolved very fast. For the brain, being such an old machine, working in today&amp;rsquo;s complex and distracted world is very hard. But if we use our brain as our ancestors did, we can use most of it. The following steps will help you achieve that.</description>

      <description> Don&amp;rsquo;t do something you&amp;rsquo;ll lie to yourself later. Live in a matter you can bear to remember accurately.
It is fruitless to wish you had started years ago. In the future you will wish you had started now. Don&amp;rsquo;t wish. Act.
&amp;ldquo;Why did this happen to me?&amp;rdquo; Why not? Events will never conform perfectly to your desires. Move forward.
