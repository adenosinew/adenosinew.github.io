      <description>Reference Use the full power of Your Brain to be a Better Developer 
Useful suggestions  The human brain is a complex machine and it&amp;rsquo;s a result of thousands of years of human evolution. Our world has evolved very fast. For the brain, being such an old machine, working in today&amp;rsquo;s complex and distracted world is very hard. But if we use our brain as our ancestors did, we can use most of it.</description>

      <description> Don&amp;rsquo;t do something you&amp;rsquo;ll lie to yourself later. Live in a matter you can bear to remember accurately.
It is fruitless to wish you had started years ago. In the future you will wish you had started now. Don&amp;rsquo;t wish. Act.
&amp;ldquo;Why did this happen to me?&amp;rdquo; Why not? Events will never conform perfectly to your desires. Move forward.
